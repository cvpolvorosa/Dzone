# Dzone
Dzone is a horror-puzzle game where the player wakes up trapped in a dark unknown room with only one means of escape, through the ominous door staring back at him. The player must investigate the room, interact with objects, and solve puzzles to figure out how to open the locked door; and maybe then, you will find out the mysteries clouding the Dzone.
The main goal of the game is to escape, the game tests the playerâ€™s wits, their problem solving skills, and their ability to think outside the box to solve puzzles and riddles using the clues found in the room.
